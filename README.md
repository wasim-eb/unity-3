# Unity - Food & Drinks

## Full Stack Frameworks with Django - Milestone Project 4

[Unity - Food & Drinks](https://unity-food-blog.herokuapp.com/) is an online recipe blog, where people can post and find new recipes for different kind of food and drinks. The thought behind this blog was to unite different recipes from all over the world, therefore the name “Unity”. 

## Description
Based on a thorough research on several blog websites with the focus on food and drinks, I found my purpose behind the Unity - Food & Drinks Blog. I found many websites to be very cluttered with information, ads and things that would set aside the viewers eyes from the actual purpose, which is to find a recipe for meals and/or drinks. Like my previous projects, I’ve followed this simplistic idea to put either the product or purpose right in the center with as little distractions as possible. “Unity - Food & Drinks” induces a simplistic idea of a blog in order to underline the basic 'CRUD' operations on databases. 
The site's architecture is very straight forward and minimalistic. The purpose is to allow the user to focus more on the recipes themselves and not to be baffled with many unnecessary pop-ups or unwanted browsing. 

## UX
### Why This Project
The main goal with this project was to create a Full Stack web application to demonstrate the knowledge and skillset obtained throughout the course. 
A passing grade in this project is required to graduate the course and obtain the Certification Degree. 
The site is using Python and Django Framework with a back-end database (PostgreSQL) for the back-end stack.
HTML5, CSS3 with Bootstrap 4.5 as framework and python packages such as Ckeditor was used for the front-end.

I realised one day that one of my questions, or if you may call it “struggles” in my daily life was “What should I eat today?”. That inspired my first user story and it all started from there. I wanted to create a website where you will find no limits to what food you will be cooking today. With inspiration from all over the world, this blog could inspire new ideas and hopefully create a bigger interest with cooking food. The user is able to find recipes from other users, which makes it more personal. 

#### Audience
- Everyone who is interested in either food or drinks
- All ages, both men and women.
- Users looking for inspiration for cooking recipes
